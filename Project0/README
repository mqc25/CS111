lab0.c:
This is the source code of the program. Function getopt_long() was used to get
input argument of the program to be. The program will redirect input file 
to stdin, output file to stdout and then copy the content of stdin to stdout.
Redirection was done using dup() to save stdin, stdout to restore latter and
dup2() to redirect from file to stdin, stdout. Copying from stdin to stdout 
was done using fread and fwrite with buffer size of 4kB. Option -s would cause
segmentation fault and will be executed before all other process. Option -c 
will catch SIGSEGV signal and output catching message with exit code 4.

Makefile:
  default: compile into lab0 executable with debugging option -g. 
  dist: create a tarball of the package with format lab0-<id>.tar.gz
  check: doing simple smoke-test case which include:
  	  if segfault was generated and catch correctly
	  if basic copying from file to file result in identical input and
	       output file
	  if program are able to report reading error from non-readable file
	  if program are able to report writing error from non-writeable file
  clean: remove executable, tarball, .txt, object file generated during make
