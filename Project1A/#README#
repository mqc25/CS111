lab1a.c:
	This files contains my code to run the program. The code is broken up into several
	modules, all of which cohesively run the program. There were a few global variables
	used in the program to be freely passed around the code as needed. Such an example
	is my 'sh_flag' variable that states whether the program runs with the shell
	instantiated. This is used to differentiate some exit statuses with that of 
	the program run without the shell command. More information about the code can be
	found as comments throughout the code.

Makefile:
	This file contains three esential targets:
	default: This builds an executable lab1a with the -g and -pthread options 
	used withclean: This removes unnecessary files such as the executable and any tarball.
					       	       This is ideal for keeping only the important files that would be used
						       	          for making the tarball in the first place.
								      dist: This makes a tarball with the specified naming format with the C source
								      	    	   code, Makefile and README.

README:
	This file contains a brief description about the contents of each of the files in
	the tarball submitted.
